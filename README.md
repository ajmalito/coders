##### How to ask for peer review
* Create your repos inside of the devlabs team on bitbucket or github so everyone has read access
* Request someone who knows your stack to review your commits and provide feedback


##### How to ask for support
* Create an branch in your repo
  * be as detailed with your issue as possible (steps taken, approaches tried)
* Create an Issue and request someone who knows your stack


##### How to provide support
* Comment on the branch
* Can also create a branch and scaffold the code a bit
* Provide Links to online tutorials, documentation, that is more thorough for deeper investigation
