Sprints
=========

Sprints should be followed in order as each one builds on what you learned how to hack in the previous one. Once you have the basics in place, you will start to specialize into either Front-End, Back-End, or Devops. Sprints are ~ 2 weeks.

**A productive startup engineer should only need:**

 * repo access
 * task manager access (trello/asana/pivotal)
 * deployment access (to staging or production)


## Sprint 1
* First commit ([bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)/[Github](https://github.com)/[gitlab](https://gitlab.com))
* Write, from scratch, a simple webpage using html/css


## Sprint 2
* Branch the first week repo
* Rewrite it using [BootstrapCSS](http://getbootstrap.com/), use a JS lib too
* Deploy to a live server (heroku, linux shared)


## Sprint 3
* New repo: Consume an API, either as a backend or frontend
* Have multiple branches (dev, styles, or by feature)
* Get peers to review and submit a few pull requests


## Sprint 4
* New Repo: Start a new app platform
 	* Use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com)/Parse for database if Front-End
 	* Use a DigitalOcean/Linode/AWS server
* Use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) or another dev tool compiler


## Sprint 5
* Choose a startup, get a UserStory or microtask assignment
